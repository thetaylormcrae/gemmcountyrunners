  - title: Encouraging Curiosity
    excerpt: >
      We all, at some point, have been exposed to running as a punishment or a "chore".
      At Gem County Runners, we believe in staying curious and thoughtful exploration of
      movement together! No matter the distance or pace, we view each run as an opportunity
      to move well together.
