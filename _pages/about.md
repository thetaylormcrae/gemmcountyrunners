why_we_run:
  - title: Encourage Curiosity
    excerpt: We encourage curiosity by helping people reconnect with their bodies and discover how they move. Every step is a chance to explore! Movement matters more than speed or distance.
    
  - title: Foster Community
    excerpt: Our strength comes from showing up together. When we do, we show that "anyone can get in on this". In the end, exercise becomes a shared experience!

  - title: Contribute Locally
    excerpt: When curiosity and connection come together, something bigger starts to grow. Movement becomes a way to show up for each other and for the place we call home.
